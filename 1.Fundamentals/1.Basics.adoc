Data Types are divided into two group

Primitive - byte,short,int,long,float,double,boolean and char
Non-Primitive - String, Arrays, Classes, Enums and Records

An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.

```
public enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}
```

Records are immutable data classes that require only the type and name of fields.
The equals, hashCode, and toString methods, as well as the private, final fields and public constructor, are generated by the Java compiler.

```
public record Person (String name, String address) {}
```
