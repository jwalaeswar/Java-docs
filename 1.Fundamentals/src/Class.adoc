=== What is an object in Java?
An object is a real-word entity that has state and behaviour. In other words, an object is a tangible thing that can be touch and feel, like a car or chair, etc. are the example of objects. The banking system is an example of an intangible object. Every object has a distinct identity, which is usually implemented by a unique ID that the JVM uses internally for identification.

==== Characteristics of an Object:
- *State*: It represents the data (value) of an object.
- *Behavior*: It represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
- *Identity*: An object's identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The ID's value is not visible to the external user; however, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.

*An object is an instance of a class*. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.

==== Object Definitions:

- An object is a real-world entity.
- An object is a runtime entity.
- The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
- The object is an instance of a class.


=== What is a Class in Java?
A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.

A class in Java can contain:

*1. Fields*

Variables stated inside a class that indicate the status of objects formed from that class are called fields, sometimes referred to as instance variables. They specify the data that will be stored in each class object. Different access modifiers, such as public, private, and protected, can be applied to fields to regulate their visibility and usability.

*2. Methods*

Methods are functions defined inside a class that includes the actions or behaviors that objects of that class are capable of performing. These techniques allow the outside world to function and change the object's state (fields). Additionally, methods can be void (that is, they return nothing) or have different access modifiers. They can also return values.

*3. Constructors*

Constructors are unique methods that are used to initialize class objects. When an object of the class is created using the new keyword, they are called with the same name as the class. Constructors can initialize the fields of an object or carry out any additional setup that's required when an object is created.

*4. Blocks*

Within a class, Java allows two different kinds of blocks: instance blocks, commonly referred to as initialization blocks and static blocks. Static blocks, which are usually used for static initialization, are only executed once when the class is loaded into memory. Instance blocks can be used to initialize instance variables and are executed each time a class object is generated.

*5. Nested Class and Interface*

Java permits the nesting of classes and interfaces inside other classes and interfaces. The members (fields, methods) of the enclosing class are accessible to nested classes, which can be static or non-static. Nested interfaces can be used to logically group related constants and methods together because they are implicitly static.

=== What are the different ways to create an object in Java?
There are the following ways to create an object in Java.

*1. By new keyword*

The most common way to create an object in Java is by using the new keyword followed by a constructor.

For example: ClassName obj = new ClassName();. This allocates memory for the object and calls its constructor to initialize it.

*2. By newInstance() method*

This method is part of the java.lang.Class class and is used to create a new instance of a class dynamically at runtime. It invokes the no-argument constructor of the class.

For example: ClassName obj = (ClassName) Class.forName("ClassName").newInstance();.

*3. By clone() method*

The clone() method creates a copy of an existing object by performing a shallow copy. It returns a new object that is a duplicate of the original object. 

For example: ClassName obj2 = (ClassName) obj1.clone();.

*4. By deserialization*

Objects can be created by deserializing them from a stream of bytes. This is achieved using the ObjectInputStream class in Java. The serialized object is read from a file or network, and then the readObject() method is called to recreate the object.

*5. By factory method*

Factory methods are static methods within a class that return instances of the class. They provide a way to create objects without directly invoking a constructor and can be used to encapsulate object creation logic.

For example: ClassName obj = ClassName.createInstance().
