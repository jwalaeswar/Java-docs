== Composition in Java
---

The composition is a design technique in java to implement a has-a relationship. Java Inheritance is used for code reuse purposes and the same we can do by using composition. The composition is achieved by using an instance variable that refers to other objects. If an object contains the other object and the contained object cannot exist without the existence of that object, then it is called composition. In more specific words composition is a way of describing reference between two or more classes using instance variable and an instance should be created before it is used.

The benefits of using Composition is as follows: 

1. Composition allows the reuse of code.
2. Java doesn’t support multiple inheritances but by using composition we can achieve it.
3. Composition offers better test-ability of a class.
4. By using composition, we are flexible enough to replace the implementation of a composed class with a better and improved version.
5. By using composition, we can also change the member objects at run time, to dynamically change the behaviour of your program.

Do remember the certain key points of composition in java which are as follows:

- It represents a has-a relationship.
- In composition, both entities are dependent on each other.
- When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity. For example, A library can have no. of books on the same or different subjects. So, If the Library gets destroyed then - All books within that particular library will be destroyed. This is because books can not exist without a library.
- The composition is achieved by using an instance variable that refers to other objects.
We have to favour Composition over Inheritance.

=== Real-life Example: Library system 
[,]
----
Let’s understand the composition in Java with the example of books and library. In this example, we create a class Book that contains data members like author, and title and create another class Library that has a reference to refer to the list of books. A library can have no. of books on the same or different subjects. So, If the Library gets destroyed then All books within that particular library will be destroyed. i.e., books can not exist without a library. The relationship between the library and books is composition.

// Java program to Illustrate Concept of Composition

// Importing required classes
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

// Class 1
// Helper class
// Book class
class Book {

	// Member variables of this class
	public String title;
	public String author;

	// Constructor of this class
	Book(String title, String author)
	{

		// This keyword refers top current instance
		this.title = title;
		this.author = author;
	}
}

// Class 2
// Helper class
// Library class contains list of books.
class Library {

	// Reference to refer to list of books.
	private final List<Book> books;

	// Constructor of this class
	Library(List<Book> books)
	{

		// This keyword refers to current instance itself
		this.books = books;
	}

	// Method of this class
	// Getting the list of books
	public List<Book> getListOfBooksInLibrary()
	{
		return books;
	}
}

// Class 3
// Main class
class GFG {

	// Main driver method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		// Creating the objects of class 1 (Book class)
		// inside main() method
		Book b1
			= new Book("EffectiveJ Java", "Joshua Bloch");
		Book b2
			= new Book("Thinking in Java", "Bruce Eckel");
		Book b3 = new Book("Java: The Complete Reference",
						"Herbert Schildt");

		// Creating the list which contains the
		// no. of books.
		List<Book> book = new ArrayList<Book>();

		// Adding books to List object
		// using standard add() method
		book.add(b1);
		book.add(b2);
		book.add(b3);

		// Creating an object of class 2
		Library library = new Library(book);

		// Calling method of class 2 and storing list of
		// books in List Here List is declared of type
		// Books(user-defined)
		List<Book> books
			= library.getListOfBooksInLibrary();

		// Iterating over for each loop
		for (Book bk : books) {

			// Print and display the title and author of
			// books inside List object
			System.out.println("Title : " + bk.title
							+ " and "
							+ " Author : " + bk.author);
		}
	}

==== Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:

- Coupling
- Cohesion

*Coupling*

Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class. It arises when classes are aware of each other. If a class has the details information of another class, there is strong coupling. In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a class, method, and field. We can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because there is no concrete implementation.

*Cohesion*

Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts. The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes and interface. However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces.

*Association*

Association represents the relationship between the objects. Here, one object can be associated with one object or many objects. There can be four types of association between the objects:

One to One
One to Many
Many to One, and
Many to Many
Let's understand the relationship with real-time examples. For example, a country can have one prime minister (one to one), and a prime minister can have many ministers (one to many). Also, many MP's can have one prime minister (many to one), and many ministers can have many departments (many to many).

Association can be unidirectional or bidirectional.

*Aggregation*

Aggregation is a way to achieve Association. Aggregation represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. It represents the weak relationship between objects. It is also termed as a has-a relationship in Java. Like, inheritance represents the is-a relationship. It is another way to reuse objects.

*Composition*

The composition is also a way to achieve Association. The composition represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. There is a strong relationship between the containing object and the dependent object. It is the state where containing objects do not have an independent existence. If we delete the parent object, all the child objects will be deleted automatically.
