== Inheritance in Java
---
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that we can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When we inherit methods from an existing class, we can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. However, we can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

=== What is Inheritance?
Inheritance in Java enables a class to inherit properties and actions from another class, called a superclass or parent class. A class derived from a superclass is called a subclass or child group. Through inheritance, a subclass can access members of its superclass (fields and methods), enforce reuse rules, and encourage hierarchy.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

=== Why use inheritance in Java?
- For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
- For Code Reusability.

==== The syntax of Java Inheritance
[, java]
----
class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}  
----

==== Types of Inheritance in Java
On the basis of class, there can be three types of inheritance in java: single, multilevel and hierarchical.

In java programming, multiple and hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only.

==== Single Inheritance Example

When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance. In the example given below, Dog class inherits the Animal class, so there is the single inheritance.

[,java]
----
class Animal{  
    void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}  
}  
class Dog extends Animal{  
    void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}  
}  
class TestInheritance{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        Dog d=new Dog();  
        d.bark();  
        d.eat();  
    }
}  
----

Output:

[,]
----
barking...
eating...
----

==== Multilevel Inheritance Example
When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance. As you can see in the example given below, BabyDog class inherits the Dog class which again inherits the Animal class, so there is a multilevel inheritance.

[,java]
----
class Animal{  
    void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}  
}  
class Dog extends Animal{  
    void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}  
}  
class BabyDog extends Dog{  
    void weep(){System.out.println("weeping...");}  
}  
class TestInheritance2{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        BabyDog d=new BabyDog();  
        d.weep();  
        d.bark();  
        d.eat();  
    }
}  
----
Output:

[,]
----
weeping...
barking...
eating...
----

==== Hierarchical Inheritance Example
When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance. In the example given below, Dog and Cat classes inherits the Animal class, so there is hierarchical inheritance.

[,java]
----
class Animal{  
    void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}  
}  
class Dog extends Animal{  
    void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}  
}  
class Cat extends Animal{  
    void meow(){System.out.println("meowing...");}  
}  
class TestInheritance3{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
        Cat c=new Cat();  
        c.meow();  
        c.eat();  
        //c.bark();//C.T.Error  
    }
}  
----

Output:
[,]
----
meowing...
eating...
----

=== Why multiple inheritance is not supported in Java?
To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.

Suppose there are three classes A, B, and C. The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same method and we call it from child class object, there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.

Since compile-time errors are better than runtime errors, Java renders compile-time error if you inherit 2 classes. So whether you have same method or different, there will be compile time error.

Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces, where a class can implement multiple interfaces.

[,java]
----
interface A {  
    default void methodA() {  
        System.out.println("Method A from interface A");  
    }  
}  
// Interface B  
interface B {  
    default void methodB() {  
        System.out.println("Method B from interface B");  
    }  
}  
// Class implementing both interfaces A and B  
class MyClass implements A, B {  
    public void myMethod() {  
        System.out.println("My method in MyClass");  
    }  
}  
public class MultipleInheritanceDemo {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        // Creating an object of MyClass  
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();  
        // Calling methods from both interfaces  
        obj.methodA();  
        obj.methodB();  
        // Calling method defined in MyClass  
        obj.myMethod();  
    }  
}  
----
Output:
[,]
----
Method A from interface A
Method B from interface B
My method in MyClass
----
In this example, MyClass implements both interfaces A and B, allowing it to inherit methods from both interfaces. This demonstrates the concept of achieving multiple inheritance in Java through interfaces.

==== Benefits of Inheritance
Inheritance offers several advantages, including:

*Code Reusability:* Inherited members from a superclass can be reused in subclasses, reducing redundant code and promoting a modular approach to software development.

*Hierarchical Organization:* Inheritance facilitates the creation of well-structured class hierarchies, improving code readability and maintainability.

*Polymorphism:* Subclasses can override superclass methods, allowing for polymorphic behavior, where methods can behave differently based on the object type at runtime.

*Easier Maintenance:* Changes made to a superclass automatically propagate to its subclasses, ensuring consistency and simplifying maintenance efforts.

==== Best Practices for Using Inheritance
While inheritance is a powerful tool, its misuse can lead to code complexity and tight coupling. 

Here are some best practices to consider:

*Favor Composition Over Inheritance:* When possible, prefer composition, where classes are composed of other classes, over inheritance. This approach often leads to more flexible and maintainable code.

*Follow the "is-a" Relationship:* Ensure that inheritance relationships adhere to the "is-a" principle, where a subclass represents a more specialized version of its superclass.

*Use Abstract Classes and Interfaces Wisely:* Abstract classes and interfaces provide blueprints for subclasses. Use abstract classes when you want to provide a default implementation or share code among related subclasses. Use interfaces to define contracts that classes can implement, enabling multiple inheritance through interfaces.

*Avoid Deep Inheritance Hierarchies:* Deep inheritance hierarchies can make code difficult to understand and maintain. Aim for shallow hierarchies whenever possible.

*Prefer Composition for Code Reuse:* Instead of relying solely on inheritance for code reuse, consider using composition alongside inheritance to achieve better flexibility and modularity.
